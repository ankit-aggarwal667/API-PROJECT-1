The food is amazing and the staff really takes care of you. Our server Madan was courteous and friendly.  The space a little tight but not congested to bring down the experience.  Would definitely recommend this place to friends.\n",
      "Shreya Dutta - StarWords India 5 I visit Delhi occasionally and go for shopping around Connaught Place. My friend had brought me to this restaurant to try out their Sunday brunch one fine sunny afternoon. The starters were really good. I couldn't help myself from taking multiple servings. The main course was decent but can improve further. The desserts were to die for. I was also happy with the mocktail as it was really refreshing to sip on in this hot weather. At a price of INR 999 + GST for each person, I think it's a good place to dine in. Next time, I will try out their signature dishes from the ala carte menu.  #starwordsindia\n",

I visited this place few days back and had good time with my friends. . . ° Lovely ambience ° Amazing cocktails ° Comfortable seating ° friendly staff . Give a try to this place and surely you'll find this place awesome. . Thanks for visiting my feed Ankur Gupta\n",

      "Utsuk Sharma 5 The staff is ridiculously polite, courteous and attentive. The ambience and the staff alone deserve the 5 stars. Very family-oriented place. Saw fewer young people here that weren’t here with families. Lovely decor. Seats weren’t very comfortable  on the sofa though, less relaxing, more leaning forward. Recommend opting for a high chair table.  Stay away from the Serrano chicken- it isn’t made the way it is supposed to and tasted more like cornflour coated fried chunks with no flavor. Ordered a smoked BBQ chicken instead and told them to make it extra spicy to mask the sweetness of the BBQ sauce. It was excellent. Presentation and taste, both on point. Portions weren’t huge, but respectable. Would absolutely visit again.\n"

The quantity of good was also good. You can even spend your time here playing foosball. We ordered variety of food i.e. panner chilli, spring rolls, white sauce pasta , delhi masala pizza, paneer burger, garlic naan and paneer lababdar. Chilli paneer was very nicely cooked and had that spiciness, talking about spring rolls it was crispy and tasty. The burger was not so good ,it was kinda dry and tasteless.\n",

I didn't like drums of heaven as it had a totally different taste what from what I expected. The ambience was good with live music could have been better with the taste of food.\n",
      "Tanya Gupta 3 I like that ambience ,hookah and food was fine. I love the food flavours but it is pocket friendly also but the main thing is you have to wait so much for your order. No space for dance Service is very poor They didn't came to ask about water and place wrong order also.  Other wise decoration is fine .\n",

      "KaRtik JinDal 1 Located near metro station GTB nagar, just a 10 mins walk. This cafe is knows for its awesome ambience and food. But when we visited this place, these all were rumours.  Dishes are overpriced and the quantity is too low, for instance one white sauce pasta had only 5-6 spoons of pasta, one chicken tikka only with 4 pieces.  The Service is worst, and the cutlery is shit. This place is over hyped and didn't have working air conditioning system.  If zomato offers me negative remarks, I will give -4 atleast. Do come at your own risk.\n"

      "Anjali Mishra 3 Food-4 Ambience-3 Hospitality-1 Reason being, I visited the place in the evening..the inside seating area has low lights as it's kinda candle light dinner setup but as there were insects flying around everywhere they switched off the lights & only had candle light! It was good at first but later my friend noticed some insect sitting on her food so we requested them to switch on the lights to which they totally REFUSED and said more insects would come in though the place was totally closed. I said if they don't switch on the lights then we would eating these insects if they sit on our food & we would not notice as they were very tiny. Still the manager refused to switch on the lights & finally I saw a insect sitting in my food.  This was a huge disappointment. The staff (servers I mean) is good but the management is pathetic & not at all cooperative.  You can go for the food but don't keep hopes of any kind of cooperation from their management if anything goes wrong.\n",
